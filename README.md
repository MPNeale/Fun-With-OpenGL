# Fun-With-OpenGL

-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    I have never worked with OpenGL or graphics programming before this, so everthing was a new design skill.
    
-What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I would read the tutorials and watch the videos to try to understand how OpenGL works. After that it was mostly a process of trial an error.
    
-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    I am more of a visual learner, so I like videos to see how things are done and then I can try them myself.

-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Using OpenGL in general was a new development strategy for me.
 
-How did iteration factor into your development?
    With each iteration of running my program I tried to figure out what was happening and be able to improve upon it in the next iteration.
 
-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    This project was large with many lines of code. I learned to look at the code in sections to make it less daunting. in the future I might try to abstract the code into multiple classes.

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    understanding how graphics work and using C++ again was a good learning experience. Also I never understood before how much work goes into computational graphics.
  
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    graphics or game design is probably not in my future considering how much I struggled in this class.
